# Python Hearts ❤️

A fun Python project that draws and animates hearts in different styles using `matplotlib`.  
Watch as hearts form line-by-line, fill from the center outward, or burst into shape with thousands of animated lines.  

## Features
- **Heart Asteriks Animation**: Heart gradually forms adding *.
- **Heart Outline Animation**: Heart gradually forms along its curve.
